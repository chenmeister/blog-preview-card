## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 

### What I learned

For this project, I continued to refine my CSS skills by writing efficient CSS code and doing it myself without relying too much on outside sources. This allowed me to break out of my comfort zone and improve my CSS skills.

### Continued development

Even though I feel comfortable writing vanilla CSS code, I want to get more practice and keep building up my CSS skills.
